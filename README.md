# Projects Time Tracking App

A simple time tracking app using React and a GraphQL server for a code test.

## Setup

`npm run first-init` to install all the required packages and start up the server.

After that first install just run `npm run dev` from the root folder to launch both client and GraphQL server.

`client-cache-ver` is an old attempt at the frontend by just manipulating Apollo Client's inMemoryCache and is incomplete.
